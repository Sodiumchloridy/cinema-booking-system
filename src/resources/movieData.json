Before becoming a Hunter, one must pass the Hunter Examination-a high-risk selection process in which most applicants end up handicapped or worse, deceased. Ambitious participants who challenge the notorious exam carry their own reason. What drives 12-year-old Gon Freecss is finding Ging, his father and a Hunter himself. Believing that he will meet his father by becoming a Hunter, Gon takes the first step to walk the same path. During the Hunter Examination, Gon befriends the medical student Leorio Paladiknight, the vindictive Kurapika, and ex-assassin Killua Zoldyck. While their motives vastly differ from each other, they band together for a common goal and begin to venture into a perilous world.","showtimes":["2024-08-01T07:08"],"languages":["JPN"],"releaseDate":"2024-07-06T00:00","genre":["ANIME"],"priceAdult":8.0,"priceChildren":78.0},{"movieId":"000101","title":"f","description":"s","showtimes":["2024-08-29T00:08"],"languages":["CHI"],"releaseDate":"2024-06-09T00:00","genre":["AH"],"priceAdult":9.0,"priceChildren":7.0}]
