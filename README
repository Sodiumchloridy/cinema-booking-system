Notes from Wei Hong:

when running my file, please manually run it in terminal with the following commands:
javac -cp ".;../lib/gson-2.2.2.jar" {your attempt to run java file}
java -cp ".;../lib/gson-2.2.2.jar" {class of java file attempt to run}

example: 
javac -cp ".;../lib/gson-2.2.2.jar" testing.java
java -cp ".;../lib/gson-2.2.2.jar" testing

so that the gson lib is included.
