Notes from Wei Hong:

when running my file, please manually run it in terminal with the following commands:
javac -cp ".;../lib/gson-2.2.2.jar" {your attempt to run java file}
java -cp ".;../lib/gson-2.2.2.jar" {class of java file attempt to run}

example: 
javac -cp ".;../lib/gson-2.2.2.jar" testing.java
java -cp ".;../lib/gson-2.2.2.jar" testing

so that the gson lib is included.

and also for the python part to run, please do ensure that the libraries are installed
1) requests (http requests)
2) BeautifulSoup4 (html content parsing)

it shall be installed automatically when you run the py file, but if it doesnt, please tell me and ill try to solve it
